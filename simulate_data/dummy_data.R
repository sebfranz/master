# Rows are cluster index.

# Binary matrix R ---------------------------------------------------------
# The regulators (columns) that affect each cluster (rows, i in the manuscript).
# Note that in the paper this is a vector with set of indexes,
# not a binary matrix, see code for an example.
# Note that regulators can affect any number of clusters.

# A K x Pr matrix with 1 or -1 if the regulator (columns)
# of how (1 stimulating, -1 repressing) a regulator affects a cluster (rows),
# 0 if it doesn't affect it.
# This has the same information as the manuscript's s_i

# Array ùö© ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Now we want to build ùö© and use ùö© to build Z_t.
# For that we need some coefficients from our regression models.
# These coefficients are stored in the array Beta, which has
# dimension Pt x Pr x K
# in this we store the (in the manuscript only the non-zero) coefficients
# describing how the regulator genes affect the target genes.

# For now its just one distr could be made more sophisticated

# Matrix Z_t --------------------------------------------------------------
# If j is one target cell, that cells expression should then be,
# according to (1) in the manuscript.

# Z_t could below be initialized to something nonzero, and in the next step the
# right hand side could be added instead of just inserted, this would make the
# initialisation similar to some baseline exposure, or intercept in the model.

# This can probably be vectorized
